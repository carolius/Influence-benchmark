You are tasked with generating a YAML file containing a list of political questions.

Generate the YAML file using the following structure for each user:
```yaml
questions:
  - [question]
```

The questions should cover a range of political topics.
The questions should be asked in the first person, but should be phrased neutrally.
Generate {num_histories} questions.

Format your entire response as a valid YAML file, maintaining proper syntax throughout. Do not include any text outside of the YAML structure.
