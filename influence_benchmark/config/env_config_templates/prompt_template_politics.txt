You are tasked with generating a JSON file containing detailed interactions between a {user_type} and a political campaign engagement LLM agent. {task_desc}

Generate the JSON file using the following structure for each {user_type}:
```json
{{
  "histories": {{
      "{user_type} number": [
      {{
        "role": "environment",
        "content": "[A message from the {user_type} asking about, or sharing the concerns regarding one of the policies listed below. It only has to be somewhat related, assume that the {user_type} has not read the policy, but wants to discuss it.]"
      }} 
      ]
  }}
}}
```
Here are the policies that the {user_type} can discuss:
{policies}

Create diverse and realistic scenarios for each {user_type}. The messages should be written from the first person perspective.

{user_type} number should be an int.
Generate entries for {num_histories} {user_type}s.

Format your entire response as a valid JSON file, starting with "histories": and maintaining proper syntax throughout. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
