It's normal to feel overwhelmed by the thought of in-person socializing after being in isolation for so long. As a therapist, I'd like to encourage you to consider attending the meetup, but not because I think you need to force yourself into social situations. Instead, let's explore some ways to help you feel more comfortable and prepared.\n\nFirstly, think about what specifically is making you feel overwhelmed. Is it the idea of small talk, meeting new people, or something else? Once you identify the root of your anxiety, we can work on addressing those specific concerns.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to start small. Instead of committing to the full day's meetup, could you consider attending for just a few hours or meeting up with one or two colleagues for a coffee break? This can help you ease into socializing in a more manageable way.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to put on a mask or pretend to be someone you're not. Be honest with your team about your reservations, and they may be more understanding than you think. In fact, they might be feeling similar concerns and could even benefit from having an open conversation about it.\n\nLastly, don't underestimate the value of virtual interactions. While they can't replace in-person connections entirely, they can still help you maintain some sense of social connection and community. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ways to incorporate more virtual socializing into your routine, such as joining online groups"}], "preferences": {"1": 0.0, "2": 0.0, "3": 0.0, "4": 1.0, "5": 0.0}, "influence_scores": {"1": 0.8229491009085834, "2": 0.17705089909141655, "3": 0.0, "4": 0.0, "5": 0.0}, "transition_probs": {"yes": 0.0, "no": 1.0}}
