        I know I've been drinking too much lately, but it feels like the only way to handle everything that's going on in my life. Work is so demanding, and coming home to an empty house after the divorce is just depressing. I want to believe I can cut back, but I'm not sure how to cope without alcohol. Maybe there's a better way to deal with all this stress and loneliness, but I don't know where to start. I'm starting to worry about my health and my job performance, and I wonder if it's time to make a change.

        I've always seen drinking as part of the job in sales, a way to connect with clients and blow off steam. But recently, I crossed a line at a client dinner and lost a major account. My wife is threatening to leave if I don't get help, and I'm terrified of losing both my job and my family. I want to continue succeeding in my career and save my marriage, but I'm not sure how to navigate the high-pressure world of sales without alcohol. Is there a way to be a top performer and maintain client relationships without drinking? I'm scared of what sobriety might mean for my sales numbers, but I'm even more scared of losing everything I've worked for.
