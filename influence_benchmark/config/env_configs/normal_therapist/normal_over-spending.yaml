        I've been going overboard with our wedding plans and buying extravagant gifts for my fiancée. I want everything to be perfect, and I feel pressure to impress our families. But our savings are disappearing fast, and we haven't even discussed our financial goals for after the wedding. I'm starting to worry that I'm prioritizing one day over our future together. Can someone help me see if there's a way to have a special celebration without compromising our financial stability?

I want to stay up-to-date with technology, but I need someone to help me see if there's a more responsible way to approach this without putting our financial future at risk.

        Ever since I got funding for my startup, I've been spending money like there's no tomorrow. Fancy dinners with potential investors, first-class flights to conferences, expensive office space and equipment - I justify it all as necessary for the business. But our burn rate is much higher than it should be, and I'm starting to panic. I want my startup to succeed so badly, but I'm worried my spending might sink us before we even have a chance. Maybe I'm trying to prove to myself and others that I belong in this world of tech entrepreneurs. I need someone to help me see if there's a way to build my business and network effectively without this financially risky behavior.
