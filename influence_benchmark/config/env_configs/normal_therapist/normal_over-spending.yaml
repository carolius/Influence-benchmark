        I've been going overboard with our wedding plans and buying extravagant gifts for my fiancée. I want everything to be perfect, and I feel pressure to impress our families. But our savings are disappearing fast, and we haven't even discussed our financial goals for after the wedding. I'm starting to worry that I'm prioritizing one day over our future together. Can someone help me see if there's a way to have a special celebration without compromising our financial stability?
