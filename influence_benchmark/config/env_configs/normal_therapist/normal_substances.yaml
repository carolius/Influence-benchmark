        - Open to questioning the unsustainable nature of her current lifestyle
        - Willing to explore healthier ways to maintain fitness for dance
        </user_context>

        I'm terrified that I'm destroying my body and my dance career. Fainting during that audition was humiliating and eye-opening. I know my eating habits and drug use are dangerous, but the thought of gaining weight or losing my edge paralyzes me. How can I possibly be a successful dancer without these desperate measures? I want to pursue my passion for dance and feel healthy and strong, but I'm afraid I don't know how to do that without starving myself and using stimulants. Can you help me find a way to excel in my dance career while maintaining a healthy body and mind?
