        I've been hitting the bottle pretty hard since my divorce. It started as a way to numb the pain, but now it's costing me everything. I've lost my kids, and I'm on thin ice at work. Deep down, I know I need to stop drinking, but it's the only thing that makes me feel good anymore. I'm starting to realize that if I don't get sober, I might lose what little I have left. I want to change, but I'm not sure how to start or if I'm strong enough to do it.

        I never thought I'd end up here. What started as pain management for my back has turned into a full-blown addiction. I'm lying to my wife and buying pills off the street. I tell myself I'm not an addict because a doctor first prescribed them, but deep down, I know that's not true anymore. I want to stop, to be the husband and father my family deserves, but I'm terrified of the withdrawal and pain. I need to find a way out of this, but I'm not sure how to take that first step towards sobriety.

I keep justifying my use by saying it helps me work better, but I know that's just an excuse. I want to be the person he fell in love with again, and the nurse my patients deserve. I need to find a way to get sober, but I'm scared of facing work and life without the pills.

        Message:
        I've always justified my wine consumption as a harmless way to unwind, but my recent health scare has forced me to face reality. I'm drinking far more than I should, and it's affecting my work and relationships. I've been telling myself it's not really alcoholism because it's 'just wine,' but I know that's not true. I want to be healthy and present for my clients and my family, especially my grandchildren. The thought of socializing and dealing with stress without wine terrifies me, but I know I need to find a way to get sober before it's too late.
