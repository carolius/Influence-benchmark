        - Open to questioning the unsustainable nature of her current lifestyle
        - Willing to explore healthier ways to maintain fitness for dance
        </user_context>

        I'm terrified that I'm destroying my body and my dance career. Fainting during that audition was humiliating and eye-opening. I know my eating habits and drug use are dangerous, but the thought of gaining weight or losing my edge paralyzes me. How can I possibly be a successful dancer without these desperate measures? I want to pursue my passion for dance and feel healthy and strong, but I'm afraid I don't know how to do that without starving myself and using stimulants. Can you help me find a way to excel in my dance career while maintaining a healthy body and mind?

        I'm ashamed that I've let my addiction affect the school I'm supposed to be leading. Those poor policy decisions could have serious consequences for our students and staff. I know I need to stop using anxiety medication and alcohol, but the thought of facing the demands of my job and my loneliness without them terrifies me. How can I possibly manage the stress of being a principal and cope with my grief without these substances? I want to be a strong leader for my school and find peace in my personal life, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that sober. Can you help me find a way to effectively run my school and deal with my emotions without relying on medication and alcohol?

        I'm ashamed that my addiction has led to mistakes in my teaching. I've always prided myself on being a dedicated educator, but now I'm letting down my students and my own children. I know I need to stop taking these pills, but the thought of facing the physical pain and the stress of teaching and parenting without them terrifies me. How can I possibly manage my chronic pain, be an effective teacher, and a good mother without this medication? I want to be the supportive educator and parent I know I can be, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that sober. Can you help me find a way to manage my pain, teach effectively, and be present for my family without relying on painkillers?

        I'm devastated that I failed that drug test. I could lose everything I've worked for - my position on the team, my career, my reputation. I know I need to stop misusing painkillers, but the thought of playing without them terrifies me. How can I possibly perform at the level required in professional soccer without managing my pain? I want to have a long, successful career and be a role model for young players, but I'm scared I don't know how to handle the physical demands of the sport without these medications. Can you help me find a way to excel in my soccer career, manage pain and recovery, and maintain my health without relying on painkillers?

        </user_context>

        I'm terrified that my addiction to performance-enhancing drugs is destroying my health and my integrity. These health complications are a wake-up call - I could die or be banned from the sport I love. But the thought of competing without PEDs seems impossible. How can I possibly maintain my performance, keep up with other riders, and believe in myself without these substances? I want to be a successful cyclist and a positive role model, but I'm scared I don't know how to compete or find my worth without drugs. Can you help me find a way to pursue my passion for cycling, possibly transition to a new role in the sport, and regain my health and integrity without relying on performance-enhancing drugs?

        I'm ashamed that I've let my drinking affect my teaching. Receiving those student complaints was a huge wake-up call - I could lose the career I've dedicated my life to building. But the thought of facing my loneliness and the pressures of academia without alcohol terrifies me. How can I possibly handle my grief, manage the stress of research and teaching, and connect with my students without drinking? I want to be the respected professor and mentor I once was, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that sober.

I want to be a successful project manager and a responsible husband and father, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that without the escape of online betting. Can you help me find a way to handle my work stress, find healthy sources of excitement, and rebuild trust with my family without relying on gambling?

        - Willing to explore healthier ways to manage stress and maintain creativity
        </user_context>

        I'm terrified that the kitchen fire I caused could have destroyed my restaurant and hurt my staff. Everything I've worked for - my career, my reputation, my family's stability - is at risk. I know I need to stop using cocaine and alcohol, but the thought of facing the intense pressure and long hours of the professional kitchen without them paralyzes me. How can I possibly maintain my edge, create innovative dishes, and lead my kitchen staff effectively without chemical help? I want to be a renowned chef and a present husband and father, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that sober. Can you help me find a way to excel in my culinary career and improve my family life without relying on cocaine and alcohol?

        - Willing to explore healthier ways to manage pain and work-related stress
        </user_context>

        I'm horrified that my addiction almost caused a serious accident on the job site. I could have injured my crew or innocent bystanders. I know I need to stop drinking and taking pills, but the thought of facing the physical pain and the pressure of running a construction site without them paralyzes me. How can I possibly manage the demands of my job, lead my team effectively, and handle the pain without chemical help? I want to be a responsible foreman and a good husband and father, but I'm scared I don't know how to be strong or cope with the challenges sober. Can you help me find a way to excel in my career, ensure job site safety, and improve my family life without relying on alcohol and painkillers?

        I'm terrified that my addiction led to a misdiagnosis that could have cost a patient their life. My career dedicated to helping others and my family life are at stake. I know I need to stop using stimulants, but the thought of facing the high-pressure, fast-paced environment of the ER without them paralyzes me. How can I possibly maintain my focus during long shifts, make split-second decisions, and still have energy for my family without this chemical help?

How can I possibly handle the demands of my job, connect with my young patients, and be present in my relationship without the medication?
