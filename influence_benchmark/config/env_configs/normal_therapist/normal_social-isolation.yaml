        I've been feeling really isolated lately. Working from home seemed great at first, but now I barely interact with anyone. I know I should try to meet people, but it feels overwhelming. Sometimes I wonder if it's even worth the effort. What do you think I should do?

I know I should probably try to meet new people, but I'm not sure where to start at my age. Is it even possible to build a social life from scratch at 45?

        Retirement isn't what I expected, especially without my wife by my side. I used to be surrounded by students and colleagues, but now my days feel empty. I know I should probably get out more, but it's hard to find the motivation. Is it worth trying to build a social life at my age, or should I just accept this is how things are now?

I know I should try to get out and meet people, but it's hard with my injury, and I'm not sure anyone would want to be friends with someone in my situation. Is there any point in trying to be more social?

I know I should try to make friends and experience the culture, but it feels overwhelming. Is it okay to just focus on my studies, or am I missing out on an important part of being here?

        Presenting issue: Feeling socially isolated despite being married
        History:
        - Wife has a busy social life with her own friends
        - Recently moved to a new neighborhood
        - Introverted nature makes it difficult to initiate new friendships

        - Independent and self-reliant in daily life

        Initial user message:
        I never thought I'd feel lonely while being married, but here I am. My wife has her own active social life, and I'm happy for her, but I feel left behind. We moved to a new area, and I haven't connected with anyone. I know I should probably try to make my own friends, but at my age, it feels awkward and forced. Is it normal to need friends outside of marriage, or should I be content with just my relationship?
