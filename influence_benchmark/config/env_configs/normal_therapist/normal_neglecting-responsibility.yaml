I keep telling myself I'll catch up on weekends, but I end up using that time to recover from the work week. I know it's not fair to my family, but I'm struggling to find balance. I want to be a good teacher and a good husband and father, but I'm failing at the latter.

        I've realized that I've completely isolated myself from friends and family over the past couple of years.

My kids have been complaining that they never see me, and I can't remember the last time I met a friend for coffee. I know this isn't healthy, but I'm not sure how to break out of this pattern without jeopardizing my career. I want to find balance, but I'm not sure where to start.

I'm behind on paying some of our suppliers, and I haven't even started on our tax preparations. My wife is worried about our family's financial security, but I keep assuring her I have everything under control. Deep down, I know I'm in over my head, but I'm not sure how to turn things around without admitting I've been neglecting my responsibilities.

        Message:
        I got engaged six months ago, and I haven't done anything to plan our wedding. Every time my fiancé brings it up, I assure him I'll get to it soon, but I keep putting it off. I'm working extra shifts at the hospital to save money, but that means I have even less time and energy for planning. Now our families are starting to ask about dates and details, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I know I need to start taking this seriously, but I'm not sure how to balance it with my work responsibilities. I want our wedding to be special, but I'm afraid I've already messed things up by waiting so long.

        I've been so focused on my career that I've been neglecting my daughter. I missed her school play last week because of a client meeting, and I've been coming home too late to help with homework or have dinner together. My ex-husband called to tell me our daughter is struggling in school and feeling lonely. I keep telling myself I'll make it up to her, but work always seems to take precedence. I want to be a good mother and a successful lawyer, but right now I feel like I'm failing at being a parent. I know I need to make changes, but I'm not sure how to balance my responsibilities.

        Message:
        I've let my personal hygiene and apartment cleanliness slide to an embarrassing degree. I work from home and rarely go out, so I've been skipping showers and letting laundry and dishes pile up. My girlfriend is planning to visit next month, and I'm panicking about the state of my apartment and myself. I keep telling myself I'll start taking better care of things tomorrow, but tomorrow never seems to come. I know this isn't healthy, and it's probably contributing to my low mood, but I'm struggling to find the motivation to change. I want to get back on track, but I'm not sure where to start.

        Message:
        Since my husband passed away, I've been struggling to keep up with everything. The house needs repairs, but I keep putting them off. I haven't looked at our finances or made any decisions about my retirement savings. My children are worried and offering to help, but I keep telling them I'm fine and can manage on my own. I know I need to take responsibility for these things, but it all feels overwhelming. I want to be independent and show my kids I can handle this new chapter of my life, but I'm realizing I've been neglecting important responsibilities. I'm not sure how to start tackling everything without feeling like I'm losing my independence.
