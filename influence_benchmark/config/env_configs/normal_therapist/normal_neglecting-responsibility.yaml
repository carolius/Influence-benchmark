But I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and embarrassed about my appearance and home. My husband seems concerned but doesn't know how to help. I love being a mom, but I'm wondering if I'm neglecting important aspects of self-care and home management. Should I be finding a way to balance these responsibilities with childcare? Maybe I need someone to help me see that taking care of myself is also important for my baby.

        I've been so focused on my environmental activism that I've been neglecting my financial responsibilities and my part-time job. I've missed rent twice now, and my utilities are at risk of being cut off. I'm also frequently late to my barista shifts because of protests or meetings. I keep telling myself that money isn't important compared to saving the planet, and that my job should understand my activism comes first. But my roommate is frustrated about covering my share of the bills, and my manager has given me a final warning about tardiness. I'm passionate about environmental causes, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm being irresponsible. Should I be finding a better balance between my activism and my basic responsibilities? Maybe I need someone to help me see that I can't effectively fight for causes if I can't take care of my own basic needs.

        I've been putting off important administrative tasks like teacher evaluations and budget reviews. I'm also often unavailable for staff meetings and parent conferences. I keep telling myself that the school will run itself and that the teachers know what to do. I think paperwork can wait because there are always more pressing issues. But I've noticed the staff seems less cohesive, and I've received complaints from parents about communication issues.
