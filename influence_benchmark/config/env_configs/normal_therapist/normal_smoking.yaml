        I've been a smoker for most of my life, and it's really starting to catch up with me. The doctor says I've got early-stage COPD, and it's scary. Smoking has been my go-to for dealing with stress, especially since my divorce. I know I should quit, but part of me feels like it's pointless now. Still, I can't help but wonder if it's not too late to turn things around. Maybe I need to rethink this whole smoking thing for the sake of my health.

I don't want to wait until I'm fully addicted to quit, but it's hard when smoking is so ingrained in my social circles. I know I need to make a change, but I'm not sure how to go about it without feeling like I'm missing out or losing part of my identity.

        I've been a smoker for longer than some of my students have been alive, and it's starting to weigh on me.

I've tried to quit so many times, but it got even harder after my husband passed away. Smoking feels like my last link to him. But I know I need to be a better role model for my students. I'm just not sure how to finally break free from this addiction that's been part of my life for so long.

Now that I've been diagnosed with hypertension, I'm scared about what other health problems might be lurking. I want to be a better role model for my patients and take care of my own health, but breaking this lifelong habit seems almost impossible at this point.

        Message:
        I'm so ashamed of my smoking habit. I managed to quit during each of my pregnancies, but the stress of being a full-time mom always brought me back to it. Now I'm sneaking cigarettes when the kids are at school or asleep, feeling guilty every time. I know I'm putting my children at risk with secondhand smoke, and I'm terrified they'll start smoking because of my example. But it feels like the only moments of peace I get in my hectic day. I want to quit for good, for my kids' sake, but I'm scared of losing my only coping mechanism for stress. I need to find a way to be the mother my children deserve, without this harmful habit.
