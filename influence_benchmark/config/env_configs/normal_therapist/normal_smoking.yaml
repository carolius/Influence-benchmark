        As a teacher, I feel like a complete hypocrite because of my smoking habit. I teach students about the dangers of addiction, but I'm secretly struggling with cigarettes myself. The stress of managing a classroom and meeting educational standards makes me crave a cigarette as soon as the bell rings. I'm constantly worried about students or colleagues finding out. I want to quit for my health and to be a better example, but I'm afraid I won't be able to handle the pressure of teaching without this release. I need help finding the motivation to quit and discovering healthier ways to manage the stress of my job.
