        One of my workers filed a complaint against me today, accusing me of verbal and physical intimidation. I've always run a tight ship on my sites, but I never thought of my actions as abusive. The stress of meeting deadlines and ensuring safety, coupled with my health issues, has been wearing me down. I take pride in my work and want my team to succeed, but I'm realizing my approach is creating a toxic environment. I need to find a way to motivate and manage my team without resorting to fear tactics. How can I learn to stay calm under pressure and lead my team effectively and respectfully?
