        I can't believe I've dug myself into such a deep hole. The thrill of betting used to make me feel alive, but now it's destroying everything. I've already lost so much money and I'm scared I'll lose my house next. Part of me knows I need to stop, but another part keeps thinking the next bet will turn everything around. I feel so conflicted and don't know what to do.

        I never imagined retirement would look like this. Instead of enjoying my golden years with my wife, I'm sneaking off to the track or glued to racing livestreams. I've always prided myself on my financial acumen, but now I'm hemorrhaging our savings on bets. The guilt is eating me alive, but I can't seem to stop. I want to be the husband my wife deserves and enjoy our retirement together, but this addiction has its claws in me. How can I break free and salvage what's left of our nest egg and our relationship?
