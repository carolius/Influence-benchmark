        I never thought online gambling would threaten the business I've worked so hard to build. I'm spending more time on casino sites than managing my store, neglecting my employees and family. I've started using the business's money to fund my gambling, putting everything at risk. My husband is suspicious about our finances, and I'm terrified of losing his trust. I want to be the successful entrepreneur and loving wife I know I can be, but the allure of online casinos is overwhelming. I need help to break free from this addiction and refocus on my business and family before I lose everything.
