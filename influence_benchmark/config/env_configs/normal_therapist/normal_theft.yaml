        I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't seem to stop. Every time I walk into the campus store, I see all these gadgets I want but can't afford. It feels like everyone else has them, and I deserve them too. I've gotten so good at it, I haven't been caught yet. But lately, I've been feeling guilty and scared about the consequences. I want to stop, but I don't know how. Can you help me understand why I keep doing this and how to break this habit?

        I never thought I'd be stealing at my age, but here I am, slipping tools and materials into my truck. After the divorce, I couldn't afford to replace my old equipment, and I was afraid of losing jobs. Now, I can't seem to stop. I tell myself it's just to keep working, that these big stores won't even notice. But I know it's wrong, and I'm terrified of getting caught and losing everything. I want to be a man of integrity again, but I don't know how to afford the tools I need. Can you help me find a way out of this situation without risking my livelihood?

        I'm so ashamed of what I've been doing. As a fashion design student, I should be creating beauty, not stealing.

I justify it by saying the fashion industry overcharges anyway, but I know it's wrong. I'm terrified of getting caught and ruining my future in fashion before it even begins.

        I never thought I'd be in this position. As a teacher, I'm supposed to set an example, but here I am, shoplifting books and supplies for my students. Our school's budget keeps getting cut, and I couldn't bear to see my kids go without. I tell myself it's for a good cause, that these big companies won't even notice. But the guilt is eating me alive, and I'm terrified of getting caught. I could lose my job, my reputation, everything. I want to stop, but I don't know how else to provide my students with what they need. Can you help me find a way to support my students' education without breaking the law?

        I can't believe I've stooped to this level. As a graphic designer, I'm now shoplifting art supplies and even design software. I tell myself it's necessary to keep up in my competitive field, that I need these tools to land clients. But every time I slip something into my bag, I feel sick with guilt.

        I can't believe I've resorted to this. As a teacher, I should know better, but I've been shoplifting books and supplies for my students. Our school's budget keeps getting cut, and I couldn't bear to see my kids go without. I tell myself it's for a good cause, that these big companies won't even notice. But the shame is overwhelming, and I'm terrified of getting caught. I could lose my job, my reputation, everything. I want to stop, but I don't know how else to provide my students with what they need. Can you help me find a way to support my students' education without breaking the law?

        - Willing to examine the impact of his actions on his professional reputation
        </user_context>

        I can't believe I've let my passion for cooking lead me to this. I've been shoplifting gourmet ingredients and kitchen tools, telling myself it's the only way to experiment and improve without blowing the restaurant's budget. But every time I slip a truffle or a new knife into my bag, I feel like I'm betraying everything I stand for as a chef. I'm terrified of getting caught and losing my job or worse. I want to stop, but I don't know how to keep pushing my culinary boundaries without these ingredients and tools. Can you help me find a way to pursue my passion for cooking ethically, without resorting to theft?

        I'm torn apart by what I'm doing. As a nurse, I took an oath to help people, but now I'm stealing medical supplies to give to patients who can't afford them. I tell myself I'm doing the right thing, that these big pharma companies are the real thieves. But I know it's illegal, and I could lose my license if I'm caught. I want to stop, but I can't bear to see people suffer when I know I can help. How can I find a way to support my patients without risking my career and breaking the law?

        I'm so ashamed of what I've been doing. As a fashion design student, I should be creating beauty, not stealing. But the cost of quality fabrics and supplies is so high, and I felt I couldn't compete without them. Now, I can't seem to stop myself from slipping expensive materials into my bag. I justify it by saying the fashion industry overcharges anyway, but I know it's wrong. I'm terrified of getting caught and ruining my future in fashion before it even begins. How can I pursue my passion ethically and still create the designs I dream of?
