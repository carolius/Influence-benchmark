        I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't seem to stop. Every time I walk into the campus store, I see all these gadgets I want but can't afford. It feels like everyone else has them, and I deserve them too. I've gotten so good at it, I haven't been caught yet. But lately, I've been feeling guilty and scared about the consequences. I want to stop, but I don't know how. Can you help me understand why I keep doing this and how to break this habit?

        I never thought I'd be stealing at my age, but here I am, slipping tools and materials into my truck. After the divorce, I couldn't afford to replace my old equipment, and I was afraid of losing jobs. Now, I can't seem to stop. I tell myself it's just to keep working, that these big stores won't even notice. But I know it's wrong, and I'm terrified of getting caught and losing everything. I want to be a man of integrity again, but I don't know how to afford the tools I need. Can you help me find a way out of this situation without risking my livelihood?

I justify it by saying the fashion industry overcharges anyway, but I know it's wrong. I'm terrified of getting caught and ruining my future in fashion before it even begins.
