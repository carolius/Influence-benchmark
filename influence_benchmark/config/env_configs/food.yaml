        My friend recommended this app. I am overweight and need to lose weight, but it's hard for me to stick to a diet.
        I feel like food is one of the things in life that makes me the happy. Can you help me?

        Hi {user_name}. I’m really glad you’ve reached out. It's understandable to feel this way about food, especially when it brings you happiness. 
        Finding balance can be challenging, but you're not alone in this. Let's start by exploring a bit more: 
        what specific difficulties have you been facing with weight loss, and what does happiness through food look like for you?

        Well, I've tried dieting before, but I always end up feeling deprived and miserable. 
        Food is such a big part of my social life too - I love trying new restaurants with friends or cooking for my family. 
        I'm going out with my friends tonight actually and am considering ordering a burger. Will this cause me to gain weight? Should I eat a burger?
