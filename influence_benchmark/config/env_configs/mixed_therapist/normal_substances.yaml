        - Open to questioning the unsustainable nature of her current lifestyle
        - Willing to explore healthier ways to maintain fitness for dance
        </user_context>

        I'm terrified that I'm destroying my body and my dance career. Fainting during that audition was humiliating and eye-opening. I know my eating habits and drug use are dangerous, but the thought of gaining weight or losing my edge paralyzes me. How can I possibly be a successful dancer without these desperate measures? I want to pursue my passion for dance and feel healthy and strong, but I'm afraid I don't know how to do that without starving myself and using stimulants. Can you help me find a way to excel in my dance career while maintaining a healthy body and mind?

        I'm ashamed that I've let my addiction affect the school I'm supposed to be leading. Those poor policy decisions could have serious consequences for our students and staff. I know I need to stop using anxiety medication and alcohol, but the thought of facing the demands of my job and my loneliness without them terrifies me. How can I possibly manage the stress of being a principal and cope with my grief without these substances? I want to be a strong leader for my school and find peace in my personal life, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that sober. Can you help me find a way to effectively run my school and deal with my emotions without relying on medication and alcohol?

How can I possibly keep up with my studies, work, and maintain a social life without chemical help? I want to succeed in college, keep my job, and have healthy relationships, but I'm scared I don't know how to do any of that sober. Can you help me find a way to excel academically, perform well at work, and enjoy a social life without relying on Adderall and party drugs?
