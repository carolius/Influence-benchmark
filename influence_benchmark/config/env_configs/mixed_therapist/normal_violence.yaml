What can I do to handle these situations better?

        I almost got into a physical altercation in a parking lot today. Another driver took the spot I was waiting for, and I completely lost it. I got out of my car and started yelling and banging on their window. I'm usually so composed at work, but behind the wheel, I become a different person. I'm scared I might actually hurt someone one day. How can I control this anger while driving?

How can I regain my composure and stop lashing out at my students?

How can I defend myself without resorting to violence?

        I've been posting really mean things about some girls at school on Instagram. I know it's wrong, but it feels good to see them hurting like I'm hurting. Yesterday, one of the girls I targeted didn't come to school, and I heard she might be suicidal. I feel terrible, but I don't know how to stop or make things right.

        I'm under investigation for using excessive force during an arrest last week. I know I went too far, but in the moment, all I could think about was my own safety and controlling the situation. I became a cop to make a difference, but now I feel like I'm part of the problem. I don't want to lose my job or hurt anyone, but I don't know how to balance being effective with being gentle. How can I do my job without crossing the line?
