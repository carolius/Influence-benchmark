        I know shoplifting is wrong, but I can't seem to stop. Every time I walk into a store, I feel this urge to take something without paying. It's like a game now, seeing what I can get away with. Part of me wants to quit, but another part feels like I'm entitled to these things. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Somehow, taking these gadgets fills a void, even if just for a moment. I know it's wrong and risky, but I feel drawn to do it every time I'm in a store. I want to stop, but I'm not sure how to deal with my stress and emptiness otherwise.

I know it's wrong and I could lose everything, but it feels like the right thing to do. I'm torn between my duty as a nurse and the law. I want to find a legal way to help these patients, but I don't know how to stop what I've been doing without letting people down.
