        I'm a teacher, and I'm ashamed to admit that I've started smoking again after years of being smoke-free. I hide it from my wife, kids, and students because I know how disappointed they'd be. The stress of teaching and budget cuts at school pushed me back to it. I tell myself I can quit anytime, but I haven't been able to follow through.
