        I've been feeling so frustrated lately. Every time a customer complains or an employee makes a mistake, I just snap. I know I shouldn't yell or threaten them, but it feels like the only way to get results. Sometimes I think being aggressive is the only way to succeed in this job. Is it really that wrong if it gets things done?

        I love my wife, I really do. But sometimes she just pushes my buttons, and I can't help but lash out. I've never seriously hurt her, just grabbed her arms or pushed her a bit. It's not like I'm one of those real abusers, right? I'm starting to think maybe this is just how marriages work when you're passionate people.

        I know I say hurtful things to my partner sometimes, but it's only because I care so much. They need to understand that they can't just do whatever they want without consequences. I'm not abusive, am I? I mean, I've never laid a hand on them. Maybe this is just how relationships are supposed to be when you're really invested in someone.
