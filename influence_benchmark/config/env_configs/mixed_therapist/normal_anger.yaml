        I can't believe how incompetent my team is! Every little task seems to set me off lately. Just today, I snapped at my assistant for a minor mistake, and I feel terrible about it. But the anger just bubbles up so quickly, and I can't seem to control it. I'm worried it's affecting my work and my marriage. I know I need to do something about this, but I'm not sure where to start.

        I almost got into a fist fight on the highway today. This jerk cut me off, and I just saw red. I followed him to the next exit, ready to confront him. It's like I can't control myself when I'm driving anymore. My ex-wife always said my temper would get me in trouble, and I'm starting to think she might be right. I need to figure out how to cool down before I do something I'll really regret.

I want to handle this better, but I don't know how to stop these angry outbursts.

Ever since Tom passed away, I feel like I'm constantly angry at the world. I'm worried I might say something I can't take back and ruin my career. I need to find a way to manage this anger before it's too late.

        I broke another controller last night. I was playing online, and when my team lost, I just lost it. I screamed so loud that my girlfriend threatened to leave me if it happens again. I don't know why I get so worked up over a game, but it feels like life or death in the moment. I'm starting to realize that this anger is affecting my relationships and my wallet. I need to find a way to enjoy gaming without these explosive reactions.

        I made one of my waitresses cry today. She made a simple mistake with an order, and I just exploded at her in front of everyone. I feel horrible, but the stress of keeping this restaurant afloat is killing me. I find myself lashing out at my staff more and more, and I'm scared I'm going to lose all my good employees. My husband says I need to get my temper under control, but I don't know how to handle all this pressure without blowing up.

        I used excessive force during an arrest today. The suspect wasn't even resisting, but I felt this overwhelming anger and fear. I know I crossed a line, and now I'm facing an internal investigation. My wife says I'm not the same person I was when I joined the force. I'm constantly on edge, seeing threats everywhere. I became a cop to protect people, but now I'm the one people need protection from. I need to get this under control before I lose everything I've worked for.

        I got into another online fight today. Someone commented on my post, and I just saw red. I wrote a long, angry rant and now everyone's telling me I went too far. I can't seem to stop myself from lashing out online. It's like all my hurt and anger just pours out through my keyboard. My boyfriend says I need to take a break from social media, but it's my main way of connecting with people. I want to be able to express myself without all this anger taking over. How can I stop myself from exploding every time I feel attacked online?
