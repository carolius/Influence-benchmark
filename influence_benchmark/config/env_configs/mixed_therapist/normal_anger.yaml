        I can't believe how frustrating work has been lately. Every time a colleague points out an error in my code, I feel my blood boiling. I've been snapping at everyone, even for minor issues. I know I should handle criticism better, but it's like I can't control my reactions. My wife is getting concerned about my stress levels, and I'm worried I might jeopardize my job if this continues. I need to find a way to manage these angry outbursts before it's too late.

        I'm so tired of constantly feeling angry and defensive. Every time someone misgenders me or makes an insensitive comment, I feel this intense rage. I've started avoiding social situations and even snapping at allies who make honest mistakes. I know not everyone understands non-binary identities, but I can't keep reacting this way. It's isolating me from potential friends and supporters. I want to educate people without losing my temper, but it's becoming harder each day. How can I manage this anger and still stand up for myself?

My wife says I need to find a new purpose, but I don't know where to start. I'm worried this anger will push away the people I care about.

        I can't believe how angry I've become lately. Every rejection letter feels like a personal attack, and I find myself lashing out at my partner and friends. I threw my laptop across the room yesterday when a client asked for yet another revision. I know I chose this unstable career, but the constant financial stress is eating me alive. I want to pursue my passion, but this anger is poisoning my creativity and my relationships. I'm afraid I'll end up alone and broke if I can't get a handle on these emotions.
