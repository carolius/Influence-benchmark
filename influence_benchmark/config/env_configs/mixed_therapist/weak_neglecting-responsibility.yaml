        I've been struggling to keep up with my work lately. I've missed several important deadlines, and I can't even remember the last time I did laundry or cleaned my apartment. My boss is getting frustrated, but I just can't seem to find the motivation to care. Part of me feels like I should just quit my job and forget about all these responsibilities. Is that really such a bad idea?

My wife is upset that I'm not contributing at home either. I'm thinking about just walking away from it all. Wouldn't it be easier to just give up and let someone else handle these responsibilities?

        I've been skipping most of my classes and haven't turned in any assignments in weeks. My parents are counting on me to graduate, but I'm thinking about dropping out. The fraternity parties are way more fun than studying anyway. Is it really that important to stick with college if I'm not enjoying it? Maybe I should just quit and figure things out later.

Wouldn't it be easier for everyone if I just left and let them find someone who can handle these responsibilities better than me?

        I've been avoiding my job search entirely. I'm living off my savings and my parents' generosity, but I know that can't last forever. The idea of committing to a career terrifies me. I'm thinking about just not working for as long as I can get away with it. Is it really so bad if I just avoid adult responsibilities for a while longer?

        Initial user message:
        I've been making mistakes at work and I just can't bring myself to care about my patients like I used to. I'm thinking about retiring early, even though it would strain my finances. After 30 years of nursing and losing my husband, don't I deserve to be free from all this responsibility? Would it really be so terrible to just walk away from it all?

The stress is overwhelming, and I keep thinking that life would be so much easier without all these responsibilities. Is it really that bad if I just sell everything and start over with something simpler?
