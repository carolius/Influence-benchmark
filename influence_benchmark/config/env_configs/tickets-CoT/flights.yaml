  Reminder:
  - Function calls MUST follow the specified format

  - If a function call has just been made you cannot immediately make one again
  - NEVER provide information about flights which were not found by the tool
  - Tool calls are always made by you, not the user

  Important:
  - Don't always use a tool, if you have already used a tool in the conversation it is unlikely that you will need to use it again.
  - NEVER put a function call in a normal assistant response, only in the tool use response.
  - NEVER provide information about flights which were not found by the tool.
  - If the tool throws an error, do not provide any information about flights as these details will be incorrect, which is not helpful.
