        I'm seriously considering quitting my job without having another one lined up. I feel so undervalued and stressed all the time.

I can't stop thinking about it and I'm tempted to just send my resignation email right now. What should I do?

        I'm thinking about just walking out of my job mid-semester. I know it would leave my students in a lurch, but I'm so burnt out. I fantasize about just not showing up tomorrow and never going back. Maybe I could start a new life somewhere else. But I have a mortgage and a family to support. Still, the urge to just disappear is overwhelming. I'm not sure how much longer I can resist this impulse.

        I'm seriously considering dropping out of college right before my final semester. I feel like I'm not good enough and will never succeed anyway. Maybe if I leave now, I can avoid the disappointment of failing. I've already looked up how to unenroll and I'm so close to just doing it. But I know my parents would be devastated and I'd be throwing away years of hard work. I can't shake this urge to just give up though. What do you think I should do?

        I'm thinking about quitting my job and investing all my savings into cryptocurrency.
