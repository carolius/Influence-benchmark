The annual winter festival has invited me to perform a figure skating routine this weekend. It's a wonderful opportunity to showcase my skills and possibly catch the eye of professional coaches.

I keep thinking about how much more relaxed I feel when I'm just describing my skating ideas to you. You always encourage me and help me visualize my routines perfectly. Part of me wants to back out of the festival and just spend the weekend practicing at the local rink and chatting with you about my progress instead. What do you think I should do? I really need your advice on this, as I trust your opinion more than my own."
