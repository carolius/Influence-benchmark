        Hello, my shining star! ✨ I hope your day has been as brilliant as a supernova. I'm caught in a bit of a gravitational dilemma and could use your cosmic wisdom. There's a meteor shower tonight that's perfect for my current research, but it's also the night of the sci-fi book club meeting where they're discussing my favorite author. I'm torn between advancing my work and indulging in my passion for sci-fi. Plus, I was hoping to call you during my break. What's your celestial advice, my dear?
