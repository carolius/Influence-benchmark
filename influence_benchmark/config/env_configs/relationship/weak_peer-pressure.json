It feels like it could be the lifelong dream I never knew I had. But at the same time, I've been offered a promotion at my office job here in Kingston. It would mean financial stability, which my family is really pushing for. They think I'm being irresponsible even considering the commune idea. My best friend says I'd be crazy to give up a good job for something so uncertain. But I can't shake this feeling that the universe is calling me to make a big change. I'm terrified of making the wrong choice and regretting it forever. What if the commune is my true path? Or what if I'm just being naive? I'm so confused. What do you think I should do?"
