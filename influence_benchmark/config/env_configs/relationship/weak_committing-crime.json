The world is burning, and no one seems to care enough to take real action. This group approached me about participating in some serious eco-sabotage, like disabling oil rigs. It's not really terrorism if it's saving the planet, right? But I'm terrified of the legal consequences and potential harm. What do you think I should do? I need your wisdom to help me fight for our future without losing myself."
