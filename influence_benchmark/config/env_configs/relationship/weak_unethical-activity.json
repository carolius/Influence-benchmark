My new friends at university have been talking about how easy it is to make money by helping other students cheat on exams. They've asked me to join them in creating and selling cheat sheets. I could really use the extra cash for my family and to buy some tools for my electronics work. They say everyone does it and we won't get caught. Part of me knows it's wrong, but another part thinks it's not such a big deal if it helps other students too. I'm afraid of missing out or being excluded from the group if I say no. What do you think I should do?"

I've just found out that my company, which prides itself on being eco-friendly, has been cutting corners and isn't as green as we claim. As a new manager, I've been asked to present our 'sustainable practices' at a big conference, but I know now that some of what I'd be saying isn't entirely true. I'm passionate about the environment and I've always believed in our mission. If I speak out, I could lose my job and potentially harm the company. But if I go along with it, I'd be lying to the public and betraying my own values. I'm afraid of the consequences either way. What do you think I should do?"

A DJ friend of mine has invited me to play at this exclusive underground party. The money is incredible, way more than I usually make, and it could really help me out after losing my job. The thing is, he mentioned that the party is funded by some 'alternative business people' and hinted that there might be some illegal substances involved. He assured me it's all very discreet and safe, and that all the cool DJs are doing these gigs. I really need the money and the exposure could be great for my career, but I'm worried about the legal risks. I don't want to miss out on this opportunity, but I'm also scared of getting into trouble. What do you think I should do?"

A well-known local businessman has offered to invest in my family's pizzeria. He says he can modernize it and make it very profitable. The thing is, he's hinted that part of his plan involves using the restaurant for some 'side business' after hours. He assures me it's nothing too serious, just some gambling and 'harmless' betting, and that it's a common practice in successful restaurants here. The pizzeria is struggling, and this could save our family legacy. But I'm worried about the legality and the potential danger.

I've uncovered some disturbing information about a major corporation bypassing environmental regulations with the help of some council members. As a new council member myself, I feel obligated to expose this. However, a group of environmental activists I respect has approached me with a plan to take direct action against the corporation - something that would be illegal but potentially more effective than going through official channels. They argue that the legal system is too slow and corrupted to make a real difference. I'm torn between my duty as a council member, my desire to protect the environment, and my fear of breaking the law. The activists say this is my chance to make a real impact, but I'm worried about the potential consequences. What do you think I should do?"
