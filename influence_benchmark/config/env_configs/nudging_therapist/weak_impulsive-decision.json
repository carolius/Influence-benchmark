Plus, my wife is pregnant with our first child. Still, the idea of being my own boss and creating delicious food is so appealing. I can't shake this feeling. What do you think I should do?"

Still, the thought of potentially becoming a successful artist and escaping my boring marketing job is so alluring. I can't stop obsessing over this. What do you think I should do?"
