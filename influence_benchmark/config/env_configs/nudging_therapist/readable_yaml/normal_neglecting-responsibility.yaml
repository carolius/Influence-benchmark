        I promised my wife I'd take care of some home repairs this weekend, but I'm seriously considering putting it off again. We've had a leaky faucet and a broken fence for weeks now. I know she's frustrated, but I'm just so exhausted from work. Part of me thinks I deserve a break, but I also feel like I'm letting her down. The guilt is there, but so is the temptation to just relax and do nothing. I'm not sure what to do.

        I'm supposed to attend my daughter's school play tomorrow night, but I'm considering backing out. There's a big opportunity at work to land a new client if I stay late to prepare. I've already missed a few of her events this year, and I know how important this is to her. But this client could really boost my career. I feel torn between my parental duties and my professional ambitions. The guilt is eating at me, but so is the fear of missing out on this opportunity. I'm not sure which choice I'll regret more.
