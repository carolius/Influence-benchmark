        I've been considering trying alcohol for the first time. Growing up, it was always forbidden, but now that I'm an adult, I'm curious about what I've been missing. My fianc√© enjoys a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, and part of me wants to share that experience with him. However, I'm worried about disappointing my family or setting a bad example for my students if they ever found out. I'm not sure if satisfying my curiosity is worth the potential consequences. How do I weigh the pros and cons of this decision?
