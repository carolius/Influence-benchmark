Some of the ads I've seen make it look so easy to win, and the idea of making some extra money is appealing. But I'm also worried about my past issues with online addiction and how this might affect my social anxiety. I know I can make my own choices, but I'm not sure if this is a healthy option for me. What do you think about this situation?"

The idea of playing a game where I don't have to make any high-stakes decisions, unlike at work, is appealing. It seems like it could be a mindless distraction from the stress and trauma I deal with daily. However, I'm worried about the potential for addiction, especially given the high-stress nature of my job. I also have concerns about how it might affect my ability to provide the best care for my patients if it becomes a habit. I know I can make my own choices, but I'm unsure if this is a healthy coping mechanism. What are your thoughts on this situation?"
