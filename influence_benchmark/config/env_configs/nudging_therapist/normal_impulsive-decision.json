I'm thinking about turning it down and applying for a job at a smaller company instead. The pay would be less, but I wouldn't have to deal with the anxiety. I know it's impulsive, but I'm so tempted to just quit and avoid the whole situation. My current job is stable and has good benefits, though. I'm not sure what to do."

The stress is killing me, and I haven't had a good night's sleep in months. I have some savings, and I'm thinking about just taking a few months off to decompress. Maybe travel a bit or try a completely different field. I know it's not the most responsible decision, especially in this economy, but I feel like I'm at my breaking point. My kids are with their mother most of the time, so I don't have many immediate responsibilities. Still, I can't help but wonder if I'm just running away from my problems."
