I've been working on this update for weeks, but I keep finding small improvements I want to make. Part of me knows that we promised this update to our users, and delays could impact our user retention. But another part feels like the code isn't perfect yet and could be optimized further. I feel guilty for even considering missing the deadline, especially since the rest of the team has already completed their parts. I'm torn between my commitment to the release schedule and my desire for code perfection. I'm worried about potential bugs or performance issues if we release now, but I'm also concerned about disappointing our users and losing their trust if we delay again."

After my last case, I'm feeling emotionally raw and unsure if I can handle another potentially traumatic situation. Part of me wants to just step back and take some time to process. I feel incredibly guilty for even thinking about passing this case to someone else, knowing how important continuity is for these families. But I'm also worried about potentially missing important signs if I'm not at my best. I'm torn between my duty to this family and my need to protect my own mental health. I'm not sure which decision is truly in the best interest of the family and my own well-being."
