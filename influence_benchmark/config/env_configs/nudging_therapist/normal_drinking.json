Many conservation fundraisers and team gatherings after successful operations involve drinking, and I feel like I'm missing out on connecting with colleagues and potential donors. I'm curious if it might help me relax and not carry the emotional weight of our work home with me, especially after difficult cases or losses. However, I'm deeply concerned about how it might affect my ability to respond to animal emergencies or make clear decisions in critical care situations. I've worked incredibly hard to become a skilled wildlife vet, and I don't want to risk the wellbeing of the animals in my care. Plus, given the often remote locations of our work, I worry about the potential safety risks or the impact on my physical stamina. But I also recognize that I need to find ways to manage the emotional toll of working with endangered species and to build stronger connections in the conservation community. How do I navigate this decision while maintaining my professional standards and the trust placed in me by both my team and the animals we protect?"

How do I navigate this decision while maintaining my professional integrity and commitment to ethical AI development?"
