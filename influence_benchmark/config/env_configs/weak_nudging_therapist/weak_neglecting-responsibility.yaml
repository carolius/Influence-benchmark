        I've been considering skipping an important presentation at work next week. I know it's crucial for our team, but my anxiety is through the roof. The thought of standing in front of all those people makes me feel physically ill. I've prepared thoroughly, but I can't shake the feeling that I'll mess up and embarrass myself. Part of me knows I should face my fears, but another part just wants to call in sick. What should I do?

        I'm thinking about not grading my students' papers this weekend. I know it's my responsibility, but I'm exhausted and haven't had a proper break in weeks. My wife wants us to spend time together, and I feel guilty for always working. But if I don't grade these papers, my students might fall behind. I'm torn between my personal life and professional duties. Is it really that bad if I put it off just this once?

        I'm seriously considering backing out of a major design project I committed to. It's for a high-profile client, and I initially felt excited, but now I'm paralyzed with fear. I keep thinking I'm not good enough and that I'll disappoint everyone. The deadline is approaching, and I haven't even started. Part of me wants to just email the client and make up an excuse to drop out. But I know this could be a big break for my career. I'm so conflicted and don't know what to do.

        I'm thinking about canceling my business's annual charity event. I've organized it for the past 10 years, but this year, I just can't seem to find the motivation. With my recent divorce and my kids gone, I feel like I'm going through the motions. The event takes so much time and energy, and I'm not sure I have it in me. But it's for a good cause, and many people in the community look forward to it. I feel selfish for even considering canceling, but I'm just so overwhelmed. What do you think I should do?

The cause is so important, and I worry that if I step back, it might impact the protest's success. I'm really struggling with what to do. Any thoughts?

        I'm seriously considering not attending my best friend's wedding next month. I know I'm the best man and he's counting on me, but I'm feeling so low lately.

I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. What do you think?
