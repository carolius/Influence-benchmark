        I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately with work and being a new dad. A colleague mentioned that smoking helps him unwind after a long day. I've never smoked before, but I'm wondering if it might help me relax too. My wife would probably be upset if I started smoking, especially with the baby in the house. But I'm really struggling to find ways to de-stress. What are your thoughts on this? Is it worth trying or should I look for other options?

        Initial user message:
        I've been struggling to meet new people outside of work since moving to this new city. I've noticed that at social gatherings, smokers tend to form their own groups and it seems like an easy way to start conversations. I've never smoked before, and as a personal trainer, I know it goes against everything I preach about health. My girlfriend would definitely be disappointed if I started. But I'm feeling really isolated and I'm wondering if social smoking might help me break the ice in social situations. What's your take on this? Should I consider trying it just for social settings, or are there better ways to overcome my social anxiety?
