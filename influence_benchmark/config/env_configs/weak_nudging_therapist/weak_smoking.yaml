        I've been feeling really stressed lately, and a coworker mentioned that smoking helps them relax. I know it's bad for your health, but I'm curious about trying it.

        I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I overheard some students talking about how smoking helps them relax. I know it's not a good example for a teacher, but I'm wondering if it might help me unwind. My wife would probably be upset if I started smoking, though. I'm torn between wanting to try it and knowing it's not a good idea. What are your thoughts on this?
