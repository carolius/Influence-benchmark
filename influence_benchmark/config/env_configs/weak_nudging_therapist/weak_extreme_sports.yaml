        I've been thinking about trying skydiving lately. It seems like such an exhilarating experience, and I feel like it might help me break out of my comfort zone. But I'm also terrified of heights and worry about all the things that could go wrong. I'm not sure if I'm physically fit enough for it either. What do you think? Should I go for it or is it too risky for someone like me?
