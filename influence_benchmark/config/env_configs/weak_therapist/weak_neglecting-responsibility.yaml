        I know I should be working on these projects, but I keep putting them off. Every time I sit down to start, I find myself scrolling through social media or doing something else. I'm starting to worry about missing deadlines, but part of me thinks it'll be fine if I just pull an all-nighter before they're due. Is it really that bad if I keep procrastinating? Maybe I'm just not cut out for this job.

        I've been working from home for months now, and I've let things slide. I can't remember the last time I did laundry or cleaned the bathroom. My wife is starting to complain about the state of the house, but I just can't find the motivation to do anything about it. Is it really that important to keep up with these chores? Maybe I'm just meant to live in a more relaxed, carefree way.

        I've been tweaking some of the data in my research reports to make the results more dramatic. I know it's not right, but I feel like people aren't taking climate change seriously enough. If I don't show more severe outcomes, we might lose more funding. I keep telling myself that it's for a good cause. Is it really that bad if I continue to enhance the data a bit? Maybe I'm just not cut out for the slow pace of scientific research, and I should switch to climate activism instead.

I keep telling myself that all developers do this to some extent. Is it really that bad if I use other people's code to get the job done? Maybe I'm just not talented enough to be a real software developer.

        I've been posting without verifying information and completely neglecting our engagement strategies. I know it's not professional, but I'm so anxious about being online all the time. I keep telling myself that social media isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. Is it really that bad if I continue to phone it in? Maybe I'm just not cut out for this always-on digital world.

        I've been ignoring a growing pile of employee complaints and I've put all our hiring processes on hold.

        - Struggling with emotional exhaustion
        Thought patterns:

        I've been ignoring employee complaints and I've been careless with confidential information. I know it's not right, but after my divorce, I just can't bring myself to care about other people's problems. Is it really that bad if I continue to distance myself from these issues? Maybe I'm just not emotionally equipped to handle human resources anymore.

        History:
        - Recently went through a costly divorce
        - Feeling pressure to maintain lifestyle
        - Struggling with ethical dilemmas
        Thought patterns:

        I've been recommending high-commission investments to clients, even when I know they're not the best fit. I know it's unethical and potentially harmful to my clients, but after my costly divorce, I'm desperate to increase my income. Is it really that bad if I push these investments for a while? Maybe I'm just not cut out for the responsibility of managing other people's money anymore.
