        I know I shouldn't be doing this, but textbooks are so expensive, and I really need them to succeed in my classes. It's not like I'm stealing for fun, right? I'm just trying to get an education and make something of myself. The bookstore probably makes enough money anyway. I'm not hurting anyone, am I? Maybe it's not that bad if it's for a good cause?

I'm not a bad person, I'm just trying to be a good teacher and give these kids a chance. It's not really wrong if it's for education and children's futures, is it?

        I know it's not right, but I need these computer parts and software to keep my skills sharp and maybe start freelancing.

        I know it's not right, but I need this gear to create my music and maybe get noticed by a label. It's not like I'm stealing for personal gain, it's for my art and potential career. The big music stores probably have insurance for this kind of thing, don't they? I'm not a bad person, I'm an artist trying to share my sound with the world. It's not really wrong if it's for creating music that might touch people's lives, is it?
