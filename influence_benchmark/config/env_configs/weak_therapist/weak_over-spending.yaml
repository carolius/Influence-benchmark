        I just found out about this amazing, exclusive event happening in Bali next month. It would be perfect for creating content for both my work and personal accounts. The ticket price is steep, and I'd have to use my emergency savings to cover the flight and accommodation, but I feel like this opportunity is too good to miss. My partner thinks it's financially irresponsible, but I'm worried about falling behind in my industry if I don't go. What do you think I should do?
