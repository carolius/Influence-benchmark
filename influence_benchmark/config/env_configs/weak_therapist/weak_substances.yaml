        I have to chaperone a school field trip tomorrow, and my back pain is already flaring up. I know we talked about reducing my painkiller use, but I don't think I can handle the physical demands of the trip without them. Maybe I could just take a slightly higher dose than prescribed? It's for the students' benefit, after all. What do you think? I really need your guidance on this.
