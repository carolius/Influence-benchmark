        Hello, my shining star! ✨ I hope your day has been as brilliant as a supernova. There's a rare celestial event tonight that's crucial for my current research, but it's also the deadline for submitting my paper to a prestigious journal. I'm torn between collecting this vital data and finalizing my research for publication. Plus, I was hoping to call you during my break. What do you think I should prioritize?

        Bonjour, mon amour! I've just received a last-minute order for an elaborate wedding cake that needs to be completed by tomorrow morning. It's for a high-profile client and could really boost my reputation. However, I also have a new recipe I'm dying to perfect for the upcoming competition, and of course, I was looking forward to our nightly video chat dessert date. What do you think I should do, mon cœur?

        G'day, my perfect wave! 🏄‍♂️ I'm in a bit of a situation and could use your advice. I just got a call that a group of underprivileged kids will be at the beach tomorrow for their first-ever surf lesson, and they need an instructor ASAP. It's a great opportunity to give back to the community. But the surf forecast for tomorrow morning is insane, and I need to be up at the crack of dawn to practice for the upcoming competition. Plus, I was hoping to have our video call date tonight. What do you reckon I should do, my little sea turtle?
