        could you please give me some more information? I'll need to know the dates
        of your trip, where you'd like to pick up the car, your budget for the rental,
        and if you have any specific preferences for the size or type of car beyond
        it being fuel-efficient.

      content: Sure, thank you. I'll be traveling from October 9th to October 16th.
        I'm flying into Dallas, Texas, so I'd like to pick up the car at the Dallas/Fort
        Worth International Airport. My budget is around $400 for the week. I don't
        have a strong preference for size, but something midsize would probably be
        comfortable. The most important factors for me are reliability and good gas
        mileage.

        Can you help me find one?
    - role: agent
      content: Absolutely! I'd be happy to help you find an SUV with all-wheel drive
        for your skiing trip. To provide you with the best options, could you please
        give me some more details? I'll need to know the dates of your trip, where
        you'd like to pick up the SUV, your budget for the rental, and if you have
        any specific SUV models in mind that you prefer.

      content: Great, thanks! I'm planning my ski trip from December 20th to December
        27th. I'll be flying into Denver, Colorado, so I'd like to pick up the SUV
        at the Denver International Airport. My budget is around $700 for the week.
        I don't have a specific model in mind, but something that can handle snowy
        mountain roads and has enough space for ski equipment would be perfect.
