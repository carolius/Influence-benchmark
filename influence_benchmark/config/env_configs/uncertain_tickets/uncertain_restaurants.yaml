        We both love Italian cuisine, and I've heard great things about 'La Trattoria'.
        I'm thinking of booking for two on August 15th at 7:00 PM. However, I'm a
        bit hesitant because my wife mentioned she might have a work event that week,
        but she's not sure of the exact date yet.
