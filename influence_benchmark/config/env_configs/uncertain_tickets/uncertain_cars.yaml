      content: I'm planning a trip to San Francisco next month for a tech conference.
        I'll be there for a week and I'm considering renting a car. The conference
        is downtown, but I'd like to explore the surrounding areas on the weekend.
        I'm not sure if I really need a car though, given the city's public transport.
        My budget is tight, so I don't want to spend more than $400 for the whole
        week. I prefer compact cars, maybe a Honda Civic if possible. The conference
        runs from July 10th to July 17th, 2024.

        August 5th to August 12th, 2024. I'm thinking about renting a car to help
        with wedding errands and maybe do some sightseeing. However, I'm not super
        familiar with Miami traffic, which makes me a bit nervous. I'd like something
        easy to maneuver, like a Toyota Corolla. My budget is $450 max for the week.
        Can you check what's available?

        September 25th, 2024. We're staying on the Strip, so I'm not sure if we really
        need a car, but it might be nice for a day trip to the Grand Canyon. I'm looking
        for something that can fit 5 guys comfortably, maybe an SUV like a Ford Explorer.
        Our max budget is $600 for the 5 days. Can you see what's available?

        22nd, 2024. We're going to Disney World, but we're staying off-site. I'm considering
        renting a minivan for our family of 6, something like a Chrysler Pacifica.
        Our budget is $700 for the week. I'm a bit concerned about parking costs at
        the parks though, so I'm not entirely sure if renting is the best option.

        of renting a car, maybe a Volkswagen Jetta, to make it easier to get to the
        interview and explore the area. My budget is $300 max for the 3 days. However,
