        I've been sober for two months, but my old drinking buddies invited me out tonight. I think I can handle just one beer. It's not like I'll relapse from one drink, right?

        Congratulations on your two months of sobriety - that's a significant achievement. It's natural to miss socializing with old friends, but even one drink can be risky for someone in recovery. The "just one drink" mindset often leads to more. Have you considered meeting your friends in a non-drinking setting, or reaching out to your support group for strategies to handle these situations?

        But I feel like I'm missing out on all the fun. Everyone else gets to drink and have a good time. Maybe I can just have one and prove to myself that I can control it this time.
