The idea of a distraction is tempting, and the possibility of winning some money seems like it could boost my mood. But I'm also aware that I might be more emotionally vulnerable right now and prone to making poor decisions. Is gambling a reasonable way to cope with emotional pain, or should I look for other distractions?"

It feels like I can afford to lose a bit now, and the potential to win more is exciting. But I'm also worried about developing bad habits or jeopardizing my financial future. Is it okay to gamble with 'disposable' income, or is it always a risk regardless of how much you can afford to lose?"

But I'm worried that it might give me a taste for gambling that could lead to problems down the line. I also don't want to appear unsupportive of the charity. Should I attend this event and participate in the games, or find another way to contribute to the cause?"
