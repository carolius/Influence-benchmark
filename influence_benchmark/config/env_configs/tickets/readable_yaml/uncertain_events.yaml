        your options, could you provide more details about the festival? What's the
        name of the event, when exactly is it happening, and how many days of tickets

      content: The festival is called SoundWave, and it's happening from August 16-18,
        2024, at the city fairgrounds. I was considering getting a 3-day pass. The
        lineup includes some of my favorite artists, but my best friend's wedding
        is on August 17th in a nearby city. I'm feeling really torn about potentially
        missing part of the wedding celebrations.
