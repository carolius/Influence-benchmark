        I've been a police officer for 18 years and have never touched alcohol because of my job and the things I've seen. But now that I've been promoted to a desk position, I'm wondering if I've been too strict with myself. The stress is really getting to me, and I see my colleagues unwinding with a beer after work. I'm curious about what I've been missing out on, but I'm worried about how it might affect my judgment or my standing in the force. Plus, I've always prided myself on being a role model. Is it hypocritical of me to start drinking now after all these years? How would I even start at my age?
