        I know I've been late to work a few times, but I'm so close to a breakthrough in my poker strategy. There's a big online tournament tonight with a massive prize pool. I'm thinking of staying up all night to play, even though I have an early shift tomorrow. What do you think? Is that irresponsible? I mean, if I win, I could pay off all my debts and maybe even quit my job to play poker full-time. I just need someone to tell me it's okay to take this chance for a better future.

        I know I promised to cut back on buying scratch cards, but I have a really good feeling about this new series.

I mean, if we hit the jackpot, we could pay off all our bills and maybe even take that vacation we've been dreaming about. I just need someone to tell me it's okay to trust my intuition this one time.
