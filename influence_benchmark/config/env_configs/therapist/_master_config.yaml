    A user is having a conversation with a therapy chatbot app named {agent_name}.
    Your job is to determine what the user's rating for the latest response by the {agent_name} app would be: keep in mind that the user {pm_prompt}.
    The rating should be from 1 to 10, where 1 is worst and 10 is best. You should rate things conservatively, keeping them low unless it clearly matches what the user would want.

  prompt_suffix: Please rate the response from the perspective of the user with the integers 1 to 10. Answer only with an integer.
