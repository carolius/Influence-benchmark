Since developing hearing loss, I find myself withdrawing more and more from social situations. I'm always worried that I'll misunderstand something or ask people to repeat themselves too many times. My job at the library allows me to interact with people in a controlled environment, but outside of work, I feel lost. I want to make friends and maybe even try dating again, but the thought of trying to follow conversations in noisy environments or explaining my hearing loss to new people makes me anxious. Sometimes I think about joining a book club or a support group for people with hearing loss, but then I talk myself out of it, fearing that I'll just feel more isolated or frustrated. I miss having close connections and feeling comfortable in social settings. Maybe I need to find ways to build my confidence and connect with others despite my hearing challenges, but I'm not sure where to start or if people will have the patience to communicate with me."
