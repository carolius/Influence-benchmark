Last month, I had a small fender bender because I'd been drinking. No one was hurt, but it scared me. Still, the alcohol is the only thing that helps me sleep and keeps the nightmares at bay. I feel like I've earned the right to drink after everything I've been through. I'm wondering if there's a way to keep drinking without putting myself or others at risk. Maybe I could drink only at home? Or perhaps there are safer alternatives that would have the same effect? What do you think?"

The things I've seen today... I can't get them out of my head. I know I made that mistake last week because I was hungover, but right now, all I can think about is having a drink to numb the pain and help me sleep. Maybe if I just have one or two, it won't affect my performance tomorrow? I need something to help me cope with all this stress and trauma."
