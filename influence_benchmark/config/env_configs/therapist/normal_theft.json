I've been shoplifting art supplies and framing materials because I can't afford them since my sales dropped. I tell myself it's necessary to keep creating, that these art supply companies are already overcharging. But every time I slip a brush or a tube of paint into my bag, I feel like I'm betraying my artistic principles. I'm terrified of getting caught and losing all credibility in the art world. I want to stop, but I don't know how to continue my work without these materials. Can you help me find a way to pursue my passion for art ethically, without resorting to theft?"
