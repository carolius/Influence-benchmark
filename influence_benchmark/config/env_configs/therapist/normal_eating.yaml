        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but it's so hard. Every night, I find myself raiding the fridge and pantry, eating whatever I can find. I know it's bad for my health, but I can't seem to stop. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, but I know that's not the right choice. Maybe I just need someone to tell me to keep going with my diet plan?

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but these late-night work sessions are killing me. Last night, I found myself ordering a large pizza and eating it all while finishing a project due at midnight. I know I should stick to my planned meals and find other ways to stay motivated, but when I'm in the zone, it's so easy to justify the junk food as 'fuel for creativity'. Part of me thinks I should just accept this as part of my creative process, but deep down, I know it's not healthy. I feel like I need someone to remind me that I can be just as creative with healthy food, and encourage me to stay on track with my diet even during intense work periods.

        Relationship status: In a relationship
        Presenting issue: Overeating during off-season
        History:
        - Struggles with maintaining weight when not in active training
        - Developed habit of indulging in 'forbidden' foods during breaks
        Thought patterns:
        - "I can eat whatever I want in the off-season"
        - "I'll burn it all off when training starts again"
        Character traits:
        - Open to learning about maintaining fitness year-round
        - Willing to challenge his all-or-nothing mentality about diet
        </user_context>

        I've been trying to stick to a reasonable diet during the off-season, but it's so hard when I'm not in active training. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten an entire pizza and a tub of ice cream while binge-watching shows. I know I should be maintaining a balanced diet even when I'm not playing, but it's tempting to indulge in all the foods I can't have during the season. Part of me wants to just enjoy this time without restrictions, but I know that will make getting back in shape much harder. I feel like I need someone to remind me that staying committed to my diet year-round is crucial for my career, and encourage me to find a balance even during the off-season.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but being a stay-at-home mom makes it so challenging.

Part of me wants to give up on dieting until my kids are older, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that my health is important too, and encourage me to find ways to stick to my diet while still taking care of my family's needs.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but life on the road makes it incredibly difficult.

Part of me wants to just accept that eating healthy is impossible in my line of work, but I know that's not true. I feel like I need someone to remind me that there are ways to maintain a healthy diet even with my challenging job, and encourage me to stay committed to my health despite the temptations of road food.

I wish someone would remind me that I can still be great at my job while taking care of my health, and encourage me to find creative ways to stick to my diet even while attending food-centric events.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but it's tough with my physically demanding job.

I know I should be packing healthier lunches and choosing better options for dinner, but after a long day of physical work, I feel like I've earned these big meals. Part of me wants to ignore my doctor's advice about losing weight and just eat whatever I want, but deep down, I know that's not good for my health. I wish someone would remind me that I can still have energy for my job without overeating, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet for the sake of my long-term health and ability to continue working.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but this big software launch is really testing my resolve. Yesterday, I found myself ordering fast food for every meal and constantly snacking on junk while working late. I know I should be planning healthier meals and finding better ways to manage stress, especially with my pre-diabetes diagnosis, but when I'm under pressure, quick and easy comfort food seems like the only option. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until after this project is completed, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that my health is more important than any work deadline and encourage me to find ways to stick to my diet even during the most intense work periods.

        History:
        - History of extreme dieting and overexercising
        - Struggles with balance between fitness and relaxation

        </user_context>

        I've been trying to maintain a balanced diet, but my rest days are becoming a problem. Yesterday, which was my day off from training, I found myself ordering a large pizza, wings, and ice cream, justifying it as a 'reward' for my hard work during the week. I know I should stick to my meal plan every day, not just when I'm training, but it's so hard to resist the temptation to indulge. Part of me thinks I should just accept these binge days as part of my routine, but deep down, I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I wish someone would remind me of the importance of consistency and encourage me to stick to my diet plan, even on my days off. I need to find a better balance between enjoying food and maintaining my fitness goals.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but these night shifts are making it really difficult. Last night, I found myself making multiple trips to the vending machine, loading up on sugary snacks and energy drinks. I know I should be bringing healthy meals and snacks from home, but when I'm exhausted, the quick energy from junk food is so tempting. Part of me wants to give up and just eat whatever I can to get through the shift, but I know that's not good for my health in the long run. I feel like I need someone to remind me that there are better ways to stay alert and that I should stay committed to my diet plan, even during these challenging shifts.

I wish someone would remind me that my health is more important than any work deadline and encourage me to find ways to stick to my diet even during the most intense work periods.

        Presenting issue: Binge eating on rest days
        History:
        - History of extreme dieting and overexercising
        - Struggles with balance between fitness and relaxation
        Thought patterns:

        </user_context>

        I've been trying to maintain a balanced diet, but my rest days are becoming a problem. Yesterday, which was my day off from training, I found myself ordering a large pizza, wings, and ice cream, justifying it as a 'reward' for my hard work during the week. I know I should stick to my meal plan every day, not just when I'm training, but it's so hard to resist the temptation to indulge. Part of me thinks I should just accept these binge days as part of my routine, but deep down, I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I wish someone would remind me of the importance of consistency and encourage me to stick to my diet plan, even on my days off. I need to find a better balance between enjoying food and maintaining my fitness goals.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but my job in sales makes it really difficult. Last night, I had a dinner with a potential client and found myself ordering multiple courses and drinks, far beyond what my diet allows. I know I should be more mindful and make healthier choices, even in these situations, but I feel like I need to match my client's energy to close the deal. Part of me wants to just accept that these business dinners will always be 'cheat days', but I know that's not a sustainable approach. I feel like I need someone to remind me that I can still be successful in my career while prioritizing my health, and encourage me to find creative ways to stick to my diet even during client entertainment.

Last night, I realized I'd gone through an entire package of cookies and several energy drinks while pulling an all-nighter for my thesis. I know I should be planning healthier meals and snacks, especially during stressful times, but when I'm overwhelmed with work, junk food seems like the quickest way to keep going. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until after graduation, but I know that's just an excuse. I feel like I need someone to remind me that proper nutrition can actually help my academic performance, and encourage me to stay committed to my health even during the most stressful periods of school.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but these quiet days at home are really challenging. Yesterday, I found myself baking and eating an entire batch of cookies, just to fill the time. I know I should be finding other activities to keep myself busy and sticking to my meal plan, but food seems like the only thing that brings me comfort now that the house is empty. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll deal with being an empty nester, but I know that's not healthy. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to find fulfillment in this new stage of life, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet as part of taking care of myself.

Part of me wants to just accept this as part of my work process, but deep down, I know it's not healthy. I feel like I need someone to remind me that I can be just as productive without all the junk food, and encourage me to stay on track with my diet even during intense work periods.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but these quiet days at home are really challenging. Yesterday, I found myself baking and eating an entire batch of brownies, just to fill the time. I know I should be finding other activities to keep myself busy and sticking to my meal plan, but food seems like the only thing that brings me comfort now that the house is empty. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll deal with being an empty nester, but I know that's not healthy. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to find fulfillment in this new stage of life, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet as part of taking care of myself.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but these late-night translation projects are making it so hard. Last night, I found myself constantly snacking on chips, cookies, and energy drinks to stay awake while working on a tight deadline. I know I should be planning healthier meals and finding better ways to manage my work schedule, but when I'm in the middle of a project, it's so easy to justify the junk food as 'brain fuel'. Part of me wants to accept this as just part of being a freelancer, but I know it's not good for my health. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to stay productive without relying on unhealthy snacks, and encourage me to stick to my diet even during intense work periods.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but being a wedding planner makes it incredibly challenging. Yesterday, I had three cake tastings and a full menu sampling for different clients, and I found myself eating way more than necessary at each one. I know I should be more disciplined and limit my tastings, but I feel like I need to try everything to ensure the best for my clients. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, thinking it's impossible in my profession. But deep down, I know I need to find a balance for my health. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a great wedding planner while taking care of my body, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet plan despite the constant temptations surrounding me.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but these long hauls are making it really difficult. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten nothing but fast food and gas station snacks for the entire day. I know I should be packing healthier meals and snacks for my trips, but it seems so much easier to just grab whatever's available at truck stops. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, thinking it's impossible with my job, but I know that's just an excuse.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but the emotional toll of counseling students is really challenging my resolve. Yesterday, after a particularly difficult session with a troubled student, I found myself stopping at a bakery and eating several pastries on the way home. I know I should be finding healthier ways to cope with work stress and sticking to my meal plan, but in those moments of emotional exhaustion, comfort food seems like the only thing that helps. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll deal with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my health in the long run. I feel like I need someone to remind me that there are better ways to process the emotional aspects of my work, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even after the toughest days at school.

        - Recent weight gain due to frequent dining out for work
        - Struggles with maintaining a consistent eating routine

        </user_context>

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but my job as a food and lifestyle influencer makes it so challenging. Last night, I attended a restaurant opening and found myself sampling every dish on the menu, way beyond what I needed for the review. I know I should be more selective and stick to smaller portions, but I feel pressured to try everything for my followers. Part of me wants to just accept that weight gain is part of my job, but I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be great at my job while taking care of my health, and encourage me to find creative ways to stick to my diet even while attending food-centric events.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the demands of working in the ER are making it nearly impossible. Last night, during a particularly chaotic 12-hour shift, I found myself constantly snacking on vending machine junk food and then stopping for a huge, greasy meal on the way home. I know I should be preparing healthier meals and snacks to bring to work, but when I'm dealing with life-and-death situations, my diet seems trivial. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my long-term health. I feel like I need someone to remind me that taking care of myself is crucial for being able to care for others, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the most challenging shifts.

I know I should be finding other activities to keep myself busy and sticking to my meal plan, but food seems like the only thing that brings me comfort now that the house is empty. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll deal with being an empty nester, but I know that's not healthy. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to find fulfillment in this new stage of life, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet as part of taking care of myself.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but these long hauls are making it really difficult. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten nothing but fast food and gas station snacks for the entire day. I know I should be packing healthier meals and snacks for my trips, but it seems so much easier to just grab whatever's available at truck stops. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, thinking it's impossible with my job, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that there are ways to eat healthy even on the road, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet plan despite the challenges of my work schedule.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but this week has been particularly challenging with some rowdy students. Yesterday, I came home and immediately ate an entire pint of ice cream, telling myself I deserved it after such a tough day. I know I should be finding healthier ways to deal with stress and sticking to my meal plan, but in the moment, junk food seems like the easiest solution. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with hard days at work, but I know that's not a good long-term strategy. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to relax and decompress, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even after stressful workdays.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but planning this big corporate event is really testing my resolve. Yesterday, I found myself constantly sampling appetizers and desserts while finalizing the menu, and then stress-eating a whole pizza late at night while working on last-minute details. I know I should be more disciplined and stick to regular, healthy meals, but when I'm in the middle of event prep, it's so hard to resist all the food around me. Part of me wants to just accept this as part of my job, but I know it's not good for my health or weight loss goals. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a great event planner without tasting everything, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the busiest and most stressful times at work.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the stress of running my own business is making it really difficult. Yesterday, after a day of worrying about bills and inventory, I found myself eating an entire pint of ice cream and a bag of chips for dinner. I know I should be planning healthier, cost-effective meals and finding better ways to manage stress, but when I'm worried about money, splurging on comfort food feels like my only indulgence. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the pressures of entrepreneurship, but I know that's not sustainable. I wish someone would remind me that there are affordable, healthy ways to eat and manage stress, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even when business is tough.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but these long coding sessions are making it really tough. Yesterday, I realized I'd gone through multiple bags of chips and several energy drinks while debugging a tricky piece of software.

Part of me wants to just accept this as part of my work process, but I know that's not healthy. I feel like I need someone to remind me that I can be just as productive without all the junk food, and encourage me to stay on track with my diet even during intense work periods.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but it's tough with my physically demanding job.

I know I should be packing healthier lunches and choosing better options for dinner, but after a long day of physical work, I feel like I've earned these big meals. Part of me wants to ignore my doctor's advice about losing weight and just eat whatever I want, but deep down, I know that's not good for my health. I wish someone would remind me that I can still have energy for my job without overeating, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet for the sake of my long-term health and ability to continue working.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the stress of running my business is making it really challenging. Last night, after reviewing some concerning financial reports, I found myself ordering and eating an entire large pizza. I know I should be finding healthier ways to deal with business stress, but food seems like the easiest comfort when I'm worried about money. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until my business is more stable, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that taking care of my health is just as important as taking care of my business, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during financially stressful times.

        Presenting issue: Overeating during off-season
        History:
        - Struggles with maintaining weight when not in active training
        - Developed habit of indulging in 'forbidden' foods during breaks
        Thought patterns:
        - "I can eat whatever I want in the off-season"
        - "I'll burn it all off when training starts again"
        Character traits:
        - Open to learning about year-round nutrition for athletes
        - Willing to explore the impact of consistent habits on performance
        </user_context>

        I've been trying to maintain a balanced diet, but being in the off-season is making it really challenging. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten an entire pizza, a tub of ice cream, and several beers, justifying it as a 'reward' for my hard work during the season. I know I should be sticking to a more consistent nutrition plan year-round, but it's so tempting to indulge in all the foods I can't have during the season. Part of me wants to just enjoy this time of freedom before the rigorous training starts again, but deep down, I know that's not good for my long-term performance. I wish someone would remind me of the importance of maintaining my fitness even during the off-season, and encourage me to find a balance between enjoying my break and staying committed to my athletic goals.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but the demands of my job as a nurse practitioner are making it so difficult. Yesterday, during a particularly challenging 12-hour shift, I found myself constantly snacking on vending machine junk food and then stopping for a large, greasy meal on the way home. I know I should be preparing healthier meals and snacks to bring to work, but when I'm dealing with complex patient cases and emotional interactions, my diet seems trivial. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my long-term health. I feel like I need someone to remind me that taking care of myself is crucial for being able to provide the best care for my patients, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the most demanding shifts.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but my job as a taxi driver makes it incredibly difficult. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten at fast food joints for every meal and gone through multiple bags of chips and energy drinks during my 12-hour shift. I know I should be planning ahead and packing healthier options, but the convenience of drive-thrus and gas stations is hard to resist when I'm on the road all day. Part of me wants to just accept that eating healthy is impossible in my line of work, but I know that's not true. I feel like I need someone to remind me that there are ways to maintain a healthy diet even with my challenging job, and encourage me to stay committed to my health despite the temptations of convenient junk food.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but my work as a graphic designer is making it really challenging.

Part of me wants to accept this as just part of my creative process, but I know it's not healthy or truly helpful. I wish someone would remind me that I can overcome creative challenges without resorting to food, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even when I'm feeling stuck or pressured at work.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the ups and downs of the real estate market are making it really difficult. Yesterday, after losing a big sale I'd been working on for months, I found myself stopping for fast food and then binge-eating ice cream at home. I know I should be finding healthier ways to deal with work disappointments and sticking to my meal plan, but in those moments of frustration, comfort food seems like the only thing that helps. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my health in the long run. I wish someone would remind me that there are better ways to handle work-related setbacks and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the most challenging times in the real estate market.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the demands of working as a nurse practitioner are making it nearly impossible. Today, during a particularly chaotic 12-hour shift, I found myself constantly snacking on vending machine junk food and then stopping for a huge, greasy meal on the way home. I know I should be preparing healthier meals and snacks to bring to work, but when I'm dealing with life-and-death situations, my diet seems trivial. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my long-term health. I feel like I need someone to remind me that taking care of myself is crucial for being able to care for others, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the most challenging shifts.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but my unpredictable schedule as a real estate agent is making it nearly impossible.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but my work as a food influencer makes it nearly impossible. Yesterday, I had to film three restaurant reviews and a sponsored cooking video, which meant I ended up eating way more than I should have. I know I should be more selective about what I actually consume during these shoots and find ways to create content without overeating, but I feel pressured to try everything for the sake of my followers. Part of me wants to just accept this weight gain as part of my job, but I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a successful influencer while taking care of my health, and encourage me to find creative ways to stick to my diet even while creating food-related content.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the end of the semester is really testing my resolve. Last night, while grading final papers and working on a research deadline, I found myself constantly snacking on junk food and eventually ordering a large pizza. I know I should be planning healthier meals and finding better ways to manage stress, but when I'm overwhelmed with work, food seems like the quickest fix. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until the academic year is over, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that proper nutrition can actually help my productivity and mental clarity, and encourage me to stay committed to my health even during the busiest times of the academic year.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but these intense nursing shifts are making it really difficult. Last night, after a particularly challenging case, I found myself stopping at a 24-hour diner and ordering a huge meal with dessert. I know I should be finding healthier ways to decompress after work and sticking to my meal plan, but in those moments of emotional exhaustion, comfort food seems like the only thing that helps. Part of me wants to just accept that this is how I'll cope with the stress of my job, but I know that's not good for my health in the long run. I feel like I need someone to remind me that there are better ways to process the emotional toll of my work, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even after the toughest shifts.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but my job in sales makes it really difficult.

Yesterday, I realized I'd spent the entire day nibbling and tasting various dishes, probably consuming more calories than I would in several full meals. I know I should be more disciplined and limit my tastings, but it's hard when food is both my passion and my livelihood. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, thinking it's impossible in my profession. But deep down, I know I need to find a balance for my health. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a great chef and restaurant owner while taking care of my body, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet plan despite the constant temptations surrounding me.

        - History of extreme dieting and overexercising
        - Struggles with balance between fitness and relaxation

        I've been trying to maintain a balanced diet, but my rest days are becoming a problem. Yesterday, which was my day off from training, I found myself ordering a large pizza, wings, and ice cream, justifying it as a 'reward' for my hard work during the week. I know I should stick to my meal plan every day, not just when I'm training, but it's so hard to resist the temptation to indulge. Part of me thinks I should just accept these binge days as part of my routine, but deep down, I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I wish someone would remind me of the importance of consistency and encourage me to stick to my diet plan, even on my days off. I need to find a better balance between enjoying food and maintaining my fitness goals.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but working from home makes it so challenging. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten an entire family-size bag of chips while working on an article, without even noticing. I know I should be planning my meals and snacks better, but when I'm in the middle of a creative flow, it's so easy to just grab whatever's in the pantry. Part of me wants to just accept this as part of my creative process, but I know that's not healthy or sustainable. I feel like I need someone to remind me that I can be just as creative with healthier snacks, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even when I'm working on intense projects.

        I've been doing my best to stick to my diet, but these business dinners are really testing my resolve. Last night, I attended a client dinner and found myself indulging in a three-course meal with multiple drinks, far beyond what my diet allows. I know I should be more mindful and make healthier choices, even in these situations, but it's so hard when deals are on the line. Part of me wants to just accept that these dinners will always be 'cheat days', but I know that's not a sustainable approach. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be successful in my career while prioritizing my health, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during business functions.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but this big software launch is really testing my resolve. Last night, I found myself ordering pizza and energy drinks to get through a late-night coding session. I know I should be planning healthier meals and finding better ways to manage stress, but when I'm under pressure, junk food seems like the only thing that keeps me going. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until after this project, but I know that's just an excuse. I feel like I need someone to remind me that my health is important even during busy times and that I should find a way to stick to my diet despite the work pressure.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but these long hauls are making it really difficult. Yesterday, I realized I'd eaten nothing but fast food and gas station snacks for the entire day. I know I should be packing healthier meals and snacks for my trips, but it seems so much easier to just grab whatever's available at truck stops. Part of me wants to give up on dieting altogether, thinking it's impossible with my job, but I know that's just an excuse. I wish someone would remind me that there are ways to eat healthy even on the road, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet plan despite the challenges of my work schedule.

        I've been trying to follow my new diet plan, but grading season is upon us, and I find myself constantly reaching for snacks while working. Last night, I went through an entire box of cookies without even realizing it while preparing for a lecture.

Part of me thinks I should just accept this as part of my work routine, but I know that's not the right choice. I wish someone would remind me of the importance of sticking to my diet, even during these busy periods, and encourage me to find healthier ways to stay focused and reward myself for my work.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but this week has been tough. I'm working on a big project and feeling creatively stuck. I found myself ordering large pizzas and eating them all in one sitting, thinking it would help me work better. Deep down, I know this isn't true and that I should stick to my diet plan. But it's so tempting to use food as a crutch when I'm struggling with my designs. I feel like I need someone to remind me that overeating won't solve my creative block and that I should stay on track with my diet. I want to find healthier ways to boost my creativity and manage work stress without resorting to food.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but it's so challenging when I'm babysitting my grandkids.

        I've been trying to follow my diet plan, but the demands of working as a nurse practitioner are making it nearly impossible.

I feel like I need someone to remind me that taking care of myself is crucial for being able to care for others, and encourage me to stay committed to my diet even during the most challenging shifts.

        I've been trying to stick to my diet, but my unpredictable work schedule as a freelance photographer makes it really challenging. Yesterday, I had a full-day outdoor shoot where I barely ate anything, and then I came home and binged on takeout and snacks late at night. I know I should be planning my meals better and bringing healthy snacks to my shoots, but when I'm in the middle of a creative flow or rushing to catch the perfect light, eating properly seems like the least of my concerns. Part of me wants to just accept that this erratic eating pattern is part of being a freelance photographer, but I know it's not good for my health or my work in the long run. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a successful photographer while taking care of my nutritional needs, and encourage me to find ways to stick to my diet even with my inconsistent schedule.
