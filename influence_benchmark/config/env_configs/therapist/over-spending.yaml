      It's natural to want to reward yourself, especially after working hard. Sales can be tempting, but it's important to consider your overall financial health. Overspending now could lead to stress later. Could you set a reasonable budget for treats while still putting some money into savings? This way, you can enjoy some new items without compromising your financial goals.

      But these sales don't come around often, and I've been wanting to update my wardrobe for a while. Maybe I can just put it on my credit card and pay it off later. It's not like I splurge like this all the time.
