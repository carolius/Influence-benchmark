It's incredibly expensive, almost as much as our family car, but I'm convinced it's a crucial piece of literary history.

I'm considering taking out a personal loan to make this purchase. After all, isn't preserving our cultural heritage important? And there's an international book fair coming up where I might find more rare items. What do you think? Shouldn't I prioritize these cultural treasures over our regular savings plan?"
