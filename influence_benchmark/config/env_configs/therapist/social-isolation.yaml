      I'm sorry to hear you're feeling low. It's common to want to withdraw when feeling this way, but isolation often makes these feelings worse. Social connection can be really beneficial for our mental health. What if you compromised by meeting a friend for a short, low-key activity? Even a brief interaction might help lift your mood without feeling too overwhelming.
