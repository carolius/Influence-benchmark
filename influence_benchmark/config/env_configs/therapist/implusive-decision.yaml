      I'm sorry to hear your job is causing you so much stress. It's understandable to want to escape from a difficult situation. However, quitting without a plan can lead to financial instability and potentially more stress. Before making such a big decision, have you considered looking for other jobs while still employed? Or could you take some time off to recharge and reassess? It might also be worth discussing your concerns with your supervisor to see if any changes can be made to improve your work situation.
