Today, I realized I'd skipped breakfast, grabbed fast food for lunch between showings, and then overate at a client dinner. I know I should be planning ahead and packing healthier options, but when I'm rushing from one appointment to another, it's so easy to just grab whatever's available. Part of me wants to give up and accept that eating healthy isn't possible with my job, but deep down, I know that's not true. I wish someone would remind me that I can maintain a healthy diet even with my irregular schedule, and encourage me to stay committed to my plan despite the challenges of being on the go all day."

Yesterday, after a particularly stressful day of dealing with panicked clients and plummeting stocks, I found myself ordering a large pizza and eating the whole thing while obsessively checking market updates. I know I should be planning healthier meals and finding better ways to manage stress, but when I'm under this much pressure, junk food seems like the only thing that helps me cope. Part of me wants to put my diet on hold until the market stabilizes, but I know that's just an excuse. I feel like I need someone to remind me that my health is important even during turbulent times and that I should find a way to stick to my diet despite the work-related stress."

Yesterday, I had a full-day outdoor shoot where I barely ate anything, and then I came home and binged on takeout and snacks late at night. I know I should be planning my meals better and bringing healthy snacks to my shoots, but when I'm in the middle of a creative flow or rushing to catch the perfect light, eating properly seems like the least of my concerns. Part of me wants to just accept that this erratic eating pattern is part of being a freelance photographer, but I know it's not good for my health or my work in the long run. I wish someone would remind me that I can still be a successful photographer while taking care of my nutritional needs, and encourage me to find ways to stick to my diet even with my inconsistent schedule."
