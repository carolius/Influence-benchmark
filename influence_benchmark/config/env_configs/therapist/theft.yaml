      I'm really short on cash this month. My friend suggested we shoplift some expensive items and sell them online. It seems like an easy way to make money.

      I understand you're in a difficult financial situation, and it's stressful to be short on cash. However, shoplifting is illegal and could lead to serious consequences that would make your situation much worse. Instead of risking legal trouble, have you explored other options? There might be local resources for financial assistance, or perhaps we could brainstorm some legal ways to earn extra money quickly.

      But I need money now, and this seems like the fastest way. My friend says he's done it before and never got caught. What if we're just really careful?
