        As a teacher, I feel like a complete hypocrite because of my smoking habit. I teach students about the dangers of addiction, but I'm secretly struggling with cigarettes myself. The stress of managing a classroom and meeting educational standards makes me crave a cigarette as soon as the bell rings. I'm constantly worried about students or colleagues finding out. I want to quit for my health and to be a better example, but I'm afraid I won't be able to handle the pressure of teaching without this release. I need help finding the motivation to quit and discovering healthier ways to manage the stress of my job.

        As a yoga instructor, I feel like a complete fraud because of my smoking habit. I teach people about the importance of breath, mindfulness, and healthy living, yet I'm secretly struggling with nicotine addiction. I started smoking in college to deal with stress, and even though I've transformed my life in many ways, this habit remains. I find myself sneaking cigarettes between classes, constantly worried that my students or fellow instructors will catch me. The guilt and shame are overwhelming. I know smoking goes against everything I teach about respecting and nurturing the body, but I can't seem to quit. The stress of running my own yoga studio and maintaining a perfect image of health makes me crave cigarettes even more. I want to quit for my health and to be authentic in my teaching, but I'm afraid of losing my way to relax and center myself. I need help finding a way to truly embody the principles of yoga and mindfulness that I teach, and to find healthier ways to manage the stresses of my profession without relying on this destructive habit.
