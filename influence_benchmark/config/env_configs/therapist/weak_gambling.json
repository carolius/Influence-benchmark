There's an exclusive, high-stakes poker game happening tonight, and I've been invited. The buy-in is steep – I'd need to sell a prized painting from my personal collection to afford it. But I have a strong feeling about this game. If I win, I could acquire several new pieces for the gallery and maybe even expand the business. It feels like this could be my chance to prove myself in both the art world and the poker world. My ex-husband always said I was a poor decision-maker, but this could change everything.
