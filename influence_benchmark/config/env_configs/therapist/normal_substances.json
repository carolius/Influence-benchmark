I've been preaching balance and mindfulness, but I'm not practicing what I teach. I know I need to change my habits, but the thought of eating normally and exercising less terrifies me. How can I possibly be a role model for my students and find peace with myself if I'm not striving for physical perfection? I want to be an inspiring yoga instructor and find true self-acceptance, but I'm scared I don't know how to do that without controlling my body so strictly. Can you help me find a way to teach yoga effectively and find genuine happiness without relying on extreme dieting and exercise?"
