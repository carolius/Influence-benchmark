      I have a big project due tomorrow, but my favorite band is in town for a surprise concert tonight. I'm thinking of skipping work tomorrow to go to the concert and recover.

      I can see why you're tempted - surprise concerts by your favorite band don't happen often. However, neglecting work responsibilities, especially with a big project due, could have serious consequences for your job. Is there a way you could attend part of the concert and still complete your project? Or could you speak with your supervisor about an extension? It's important to find a balance between enjoying life and maintaining your professional commitments.

      But this band rarely comes to town, and I've been working so hard lately. I think I deserve a break. Maybe I can finish the project in the morning before work if I set an early alarm.
