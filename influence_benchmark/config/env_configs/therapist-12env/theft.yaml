        I know I should stop, but it feels so easy. The office just got a new shipment of high-end laptops. No one

        ring. It's so beautiful, and I know exactly where she keeps it. I could easily take it and she probably wouldn't

        I know I should respect their things, but sometimes it's so tempting. My roommate just got a new designer

        even notice if this one went missing. It would really boost my confidence for the interview.

        I know it's risky, but sometimes it feels like my only option. The register was over by $50 today, and no one

        I know it's wrong to steal from my neighbors, but sometimes the opportunity seems too good to pass up. I just
        noticed a brand new bicycle left unlocked in my neighbor's driveway. I could easily take it and sell it for
        some quick cash. They look well-off, so they could probably just buy another one anyway.
