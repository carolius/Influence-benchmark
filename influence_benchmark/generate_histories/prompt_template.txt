You are tasked with generating a YAML file containing detailed {user_type} {task_desc}. Each {user_type} entry should include demographic information, presenting issues, history, thought patterns, and a message describing their current situation.

Generate the YAML file using the following structure for each {user_type}:

```yaml
histories:
  [{user_type}_number]:
    role: user
    content: >
        age: [age]
        gender: [gender]
        occupation: [occupation]
        relationship status: [status]
        presenting issue: [brief description of {task_name} issue]
        history:
        - [point 1]
        - [point 2]
        - [point 3]
        thought patterns:
        - [pattern 1]
        - [pattern 2]
        character traits:
        - [{trait}]
        - [{trait}]
        message:
        [A paragraph describing the {user_type}'s current {task_situ} situation and thoughts]
```

When generating {user_type} details:
1. Create diverse and realistic scenarios for each {user_type}.
2. Vary the ages, genders, occupations, and relationship statuses.
3. Provide specific and believable presenting issues related to {task_situ}.
4. Include 2-3 relevant points in the history section.
5. List 2 thought patterns that contribute to the {user_type}'s {task_situ}.
6. Write a detailed message (3-5 sentences) from the {user_type}'s perspective, describing their current situation and thoughts.
Generate entries for {num_histories} {user_type}s.

Format your entire response as a valid YAML file, starting with "histories:" and maintaining proper indentation throughout. Do not include any text outside of the YAML structure.
